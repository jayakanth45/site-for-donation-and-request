# Hardware Donation Platform

This platform allows companies to donate hardware resources (e.g., computers, laptops, etc.) to schools that are in need. Schools can also request donations, and the system helps in matching available donations with requests.

## Features

- **Company Dashboard**: Companies can donate items either to the general pool or to specific schools.
- **School Dashboard**: Schools can request items or claim donations from specific companies.
- **Real-time Matching**: When a donation matches a school's request, the system fulfills the request automatically.
- **Session-based Login**: Both companies and schools must log in to access their respective dashboards.
- **Database Management**: Keeps track of available donations and outstanding requests.
